### Objective

QuickTask is a simplified task management app designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. Each task has a `title`, `dueDate` & `done` property.

This project introduces me to Flutter and Back4App by building a basic task management app with essential features.

### Features

- User Authentication (Login & Registration using Back4App). Allows users to signup and login to the app securely.
- Task Management (Add, Edit, View, Delete). Each task has a title, done and due-date properties.
- Task Status Toggle (Mark Task as Complete/Incomplete). Checkbox provided to toggle status.
- Edit Task (Can edit already saved task)
- Styling and other UI UX Enhancements also done.
- Error handling for authentication and CRUD data management.
